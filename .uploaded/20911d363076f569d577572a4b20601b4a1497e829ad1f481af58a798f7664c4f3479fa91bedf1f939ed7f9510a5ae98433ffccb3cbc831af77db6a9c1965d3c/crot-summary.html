The rule of thirds is a commonly used technique in photography to create more interesting images. It involves dividing the image into nine equal parts using two horizontal and two vertical lines, and positioning important elements along those lines or at the intersections. This off-center composition is believed to be more visually appealing than a subject placed in the middle of the frame. Using the rule of thirds also encourages the use of negative space, which is empty area around subjects. Some cameras have a setting that overlays a rule of thirds grid onto the image to aid in accurate placement along the lines.
